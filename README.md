# e-Dine app  

### App Description
This app is used for persons who would like to edit and create their own custom dish tailored to their dietary needs, or who would like to see which options are available at each of the dining hall locations on campus. 

### App Idea Evaluation
 College dining halls dietary needs app
- **Category:** Lifestyle/Health 
- **Mobile:** Users can use location services to see which dining hall is closer, push-notifications for 30 minutes before the dining hall will close to ensure that they can come in time, and users can call the dining halls if they have any specific questions through the app. 
- **Story:** Filters current menu options by dietary needs, e.g. allergies, Kosher and Halal meal options, vegan and vegitarian options. Students can type in their allergies or other needs and customize their profiles on their accounts beforehand, and then they can view menu options every day before going to eat. 
 - **Market:** I noticed that it isn't always very clear regarding food allergies in my dining halls and think this app could help save time for students and dining hall staff by diminishing the need to inquire about special dietary options. 
 - Audience is niche, but for college campuses with large freshman/undergrad populations, it seems that the app would provide value to enough users 
  - **Habit:** Users can use this app everyday before coming to their dining halls. 
  - **Scope:** This app seems to be complex if we got all of the features, but perhaps if we had a simple option to filter the data from the campus dining hall website, it would be reasonable to design within the scope of this course.
